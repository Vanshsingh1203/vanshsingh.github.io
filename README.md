🚀 About Me

🎓 Master’s student in Engineering Management at Northeastern University, Boston (2025–2027)
🛠️ Mechanical Engineering background with hands-on experience in manufacturing, cost engineering, and operations optimization
📊 Strong focus on supply chain analytics, production planning, and decision-making using data
🎯 Career goal: Operations / Supply Chain / Strategy roles in manufacturing, EV, and industrial systems

I don’t build models for vanity metrics.
I build decision-driven analytics—where optimization, cost, and operational reality actually matter.

💡 Technical Skills
